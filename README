Looking to rework terraform 

Trying to make the modules independant of any other so that we can call only the ones that we want for a given app 


Also incorperating workspaces so that we can create "stacks" that can be nuked or rebuilt without effecting the base or other workspaces. 


See referance for variables in workspaces
